# Web Application Open Platform Interface

## Description

WOPI or to give it its official name, Web Application Open Platform Interface, is an interface protocol that is used between Microsoft Office Online Server and a compatible file store. It was originally defined so Office Online could interact with SharePoint documents, and provide users with a consistent online office experience.

## Requirement

The HUB application generates marketing material in word document format, and stores the files within a Azure Blob store. From time to time the user may need to view or change the document, so will need to be able to read and write back changes. The users have also expressed a preference for using Word to do the editing as it is the word processor they are most familiar with.
